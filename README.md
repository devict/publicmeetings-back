# Public Meetings Backend

The API for accessing the data for [devIcT](https://devict.org)'s Public Meetings project.

# About

The devICT Public Meetings project is meant to provide an easy way for people to find out about meetings of governing bodies (ie. City Council, School Board) in and around Wichita. The project will include multiple front ends which will all communicate with this API to access the data used by the application.
